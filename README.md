# Diamond with BlastN

This repository contains the source code that was created during the master thesis "Development of a fast and sensitive pairwise
DNA sequence aligner using a seed-and-extend
algorithm for the Earth BioGenome". 
The repository includes all of the source code that was developed by Benjamin Buchfinks work on Diamond, on which this thesis is based.
